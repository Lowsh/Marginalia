Add Module for rendering to svg
	Convert inches to pixels dimensions
	0-1000px on X . Width is Constant at 1000px
	Y is relative to X

	Validation: if Y is larger than X then
	Live area dimensions are centered so that
		difference between x1(Media) and x1(Live) are same at x2 corresponding
			(xM - xL)/2 = y 
		coordinates for live area svg
			(xL1, xL2) = ((xM1 + y), (xM2 - y)) 
		y = x margin

		if n columns
			@ 1 : same
			@ 2 : then find center xL
				(xL2 - xL1)/n = c
			if >2 : then divide by n (same for 2)
				(xL2 - xL1)/n = c

				then 
					C1 = xL1 + C // scheme1.columns["c"+(n)]
				and then
					C2 = C1 + C

			scheme1.columns = {}

	scheme object properties:
	>each property is expressed in inches OR unit of input (flex with metric comes later)
	>a method that converts dims to pixels for visual output
		>pixel dims should be stored (in same data structure or mirrored)

	-x and y dimensions of media (user input)
	-x and y dimensions of live area
	-margin difference between media and live area dim
		-x diff
		-y diff
	-number of rows and columns (user input)
	- if column and rows are provided then gutters need to be defined
		-default gutter value is 0


	3 column 3 row
	
	scheme object
	
	dim array:
		0. column array at index 1 = columns (.length of enclosing[0] = # of columns)
			each index is an object by default all are set to same dim
			contains 
				width; height; gutter 


		1. row array at index 2 = rows (.length of enclosing[1] = # of rows)
